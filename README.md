# Microstructure characterisation using SMDs
⚠️ **Work in Progress**: This branch is under active development. Code and documentation are being updated regularly.

This branch contains codes, data, and documentation for **part 1** of the paper *"Transient porosity during fluid-mineral interaction. Part 1: In-situ 4D tomography"*. It involves codes for characterising microstructures using statistical microstructure descriptors (SMDs) and Minkowskie functionals (MFs). Both parts have been recently submitted to JGR: Solid Earth. The link to the papers will be provided when the pre-print versions are out. This project is part of my PhD at Utrecht University, funded by European Reseach Councoul (ERC) starting grant 'nanoEARTH' (#852069).

## Input data and examples
Here, I provide input data which are the images used in the part 1 of the paper. The raw data are segmented images and can be accessed through Zenodo repository that will be provided soon here.



## Usage
Here you can find some guidelines and examples to run the scripts for microstructure characterisation using Statistical microstructure descriptors (SMDs).

### Overview

Here is the summary of scripts in this repository:
